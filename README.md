# Mathemagicians
Project for the 2015 gamedevfort contest.

This game will attempt to leverage the thinking challenge without feeling watered down. Despite being about math, I hope to make the game something that even adult gamers could enjoy.

While the initial ideas are very ambitious in scope, for now there will only be three spells in the game.

Windows download is here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/44qa1bebs1zmslf/mathmag.zip?dl=0
You will have to unzip the game, and then run anura.exe within the resulting folder. **You might get a warning that there is no publisher.** I can't easily fix this, unfortunately.
